st.markdown("Climate change is a problem that young people in particularly have been concerned with over the past few years. One of the reasons for this is that we consume huge amounts of packaging waste, etc., and thereby destroy our planet step by step. The earth is full of garbage and it must be changed as soon as possible before it is too late. ")
st.subheader("Solution:")
st.markdown("One step to counter this problem is recycling. Fortunately, in Germany everyone is obliged to recycle properly. In other countries, this is unfortunately neglected. Since it is not an obligatory task for many people, they have no idea how to properly dispose and separate their waste in the first place. This keeps many people from even trying to separate their trash, which leads to the fact that the littering of the earth is getting worse and worse.Our app can help and encourage people to take a step into the right direction. Once you are unsure which garbage container a certain garbage needs to go in, our app can identify the garbage on behalf of the person. ")
st.markdown("The app can also be used by garbage collection points. In this way, no individual has to deal with the separation of garbage, as the garbage is split automatically by our app.")

st.markdown("Chances are that the app will misclassify the garbage and therefore the garbage might end up in a garbage can where it doesn't actually belong.")
